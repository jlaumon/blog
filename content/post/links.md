I wanted to add some kind of blogroll / links menu (that ancient thing from before twitter) to share interesting blogs or articles I bump into. But since I'm not really passionate about webdesign, 
any change to this website could take years (estimation based on actual numbers).

In the meantime, here are a few links that I value a lot:


 - [Memory, Cache, CPU optimization resources](https://gist.github.com/ocornut/cb980ea183e848685a36): 
 it's a gist with links to a lot of really interesting articles. Thanks [Omar](https://twitter.com/ocornut).
 
 - [Preshing on Programming](http://preshing.com/): Jeff Preshing's blog; lots of great articles about lock free programming (among other things).
 
 - [Random ASCII](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/): Bruce Drawson's blog; profiling, debugging and floating point trivia.
 
 - [Molecular Musings](http://blog.molecular-matters.com/): Dev blog of the Molecule Engine / Stefan Reinalter's blog. 
 Best engine related blog I know.
