Hello and welcome!

<!--more-->

My name's Jeremy, and this is my personal (but technical) blog. 

I'm a video game programmer—and more specifically an engine programmer—working at [Pastagames](http://www.pastagames.com/).

Here I'll try to talk about C++, low level engine stuff, and probably some real time graphics too.

This blog is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a really cool static site generator, 
and the template is largely adapted from [spf13.com](https://github.com/spf13/spf13.com).
