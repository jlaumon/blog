Hello and welcome!

<!--more-->

My name's Jeremy, and this is my personal (but technical) blog. 

I'm a video game programmer—and more specifically an engine programmer—working at [Guerrilla](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/) (and previously [Pastagames](http://www.pastagames.com/)).

Here I'll try to talk about C++, low level engine stuff, and probably some real time graphics too.

Find me on Bluesky: [bsky.app/profile/jeremy.laumon.name](https://bsky.app/profile/jeremy.laumon.name)<br/>
