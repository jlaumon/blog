      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of &lt;strong&gt;Meltdown&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Spectre&lt;/strong&gt;. In January, these two new &lt;strong&gt;security vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; were made public, and it was kind of a big deal: all modern processors were more or less vulnerable, all systems affected, they could steal your passwords and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have settled down a little bit since then; security patches have been released and no actual attacks have been reported. But still, discoveries of that scale are not common, so I was curious: How do these vulnerabilities work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanations I could find on the Internet came in two flavors:
the one for security experts (&lt;a href=&#34;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.fr/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html&#34;&gt;extremely technical, very hard to follow&lt;/a&gt;) and the ones for scared customers (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syAdX44pokE&#34;&gt;that will make you doubt everything you known about computers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to write my own: for people that have some knowledge about CPUs, but no interest in actually exploiting the vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
